Because the three of them are all scoundrels, they are all currently in Jail. In Monopoly, players roll two 6-sided dice on their turn. In their version of Monopoly, however, to get out of Jail, a player must roll *doubles* (the two dice have the same outcome) and must keep re-rolling the dice until they get doubles during their first turn in Jail.

If Darth Ketelsen switches the dice for her weighted ones, she does so before the game begins, and the entire game of Monopoly is played with the same pair of dice, whether they are fair or weighted.\n",

    "Now because we are using a weighted dice which makes rolling a 6 $\\Big(\\frac{1}{2}\\Big)$ we can adjust our dice probabilities to make each roll out of 10.

    "**Explanation of Distribution**\n",
    "<br> From the above graph, it looks to me like the longer the game progressed, the more money you would have at the end on average. This makes sense to me because if you only play 20 turns there is not much time to make money but a lot of chances to lose it. When playing for 40 turns, you make a little more money but also lose some. When playing Miniopoly for 60 turns, you have much more of a chance to make some significant money and so the more you play, the more money you will have at the end. From the graph, it looks like there are three different modes that all have to do with the number of turns in the game. We have the mode from 20 turn games hovering around $250, the mode for 40 turn games around $1500 and the mode for 60 turn games around $3250. These modes make sense with the longer games yielding more cash at the end, on average. "

    "**Explanation for Part C**\n",
    "<br>Based on the probabilities found above, if you play a 40 turn game of Miniopoly, you have a very low chance of going bankrupt. Even without the free parking bonus, the odds of go up by about 1% from around 1% chance of going bankrupt to right around 2%. Overall, based on these results I don't believe that the parking bonus makes all that big a difference in the game. If nothing else, the Free Parking Rule gives players the chance to earn more money and so if a player happens to land on it, it gives them an advantage with however much the bonus is for. Personally I enjoy the Free Parking Rule because it gets me more money so that I can slowly take over the board and ruin my friends days. Unless of course my opponents land on the free parking spot more than I do, then it's a nuisance of a spot and I'm vehemently opposed to its being in the game."
